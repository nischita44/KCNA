### Helm

- Package manager for K8s
- Bundle of YAML files which can be used
 Example: Monitoring Apps, Database Apps 

## Other Use cases

 - Templating Engine
    When we have multiple multiple microservices each having almost same yaml files except change in version or container names, 
    here using helm we can have a common blueprint with the dynamic values for some fields.

 - Same application across different environments like Development, Staging and Production.
